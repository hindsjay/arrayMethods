# JavaScript Array Methods using Test Driven Development
This serves as an introduction to test driven development using JavaScript array methods. 

The requirements of this exercise is to take the native JavaScript array method and build our own piece-by-piece.  Tests are completed to ensure that our function works the same way that the native method works.  Test results (success/fail) are logged to the console as the page loads.

Testing library is based on the tinytest.js library by Joe Walnes. 
Exercise is part of the curriculum for Watch and Code (watchandcode.com) developed by Gordon Zhu.
